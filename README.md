# VibeOS

A playful, retro-styled sign-up page inspired by TempleOS aesthetics — built for the Vibejam Hackathon. VibeOS is a tiny front-end demo that captures the lo-fi, nostalgic vibe while providing a modern sign-up experience.

## What is VibeOS?

VibeOS is a small, shareable sign-up landing page created for the Vibejam Hackathon. It blends retro visual styling (pixel fonts, chunky colors, simple animations) with modern responsive layout and easy deployment. Use it as a fun splash page, jam project demo, or starting point for a themed web UI.

## Features

- Retro / TempleOS-inspired visual style
- Responsive, mobile-friendly layout
- Simple sign-up form with client-side validation
- Ready for Vercel / static hosting
- Easily editable via v0.app deployments (auto-sync)

## Demo

Visit the live site: https://vibeos.fun

If you'd like to preview locally, follow the steps below.

## Local development

1. Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/mortleass-code/v0-temple-os-sign-up-page.git
2. Install dependencies (if the project uses a build tool)
   - For plain static sites, just open index.html in a browser
   - If using a node toolchain:
     npm install
     npm run dev
3. Open http://localhost:3000 (or the port printed by your dev server)

(Adjust commands to match the actual project stack — this README assumes a small static or simple JS-based app.)

## Deployment

VibeOS is ready to deploy to static hosts like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

- Vercel: connect the repository and deploy — Vercel will handle builds and provide a production URL.
- Netlify: drag & drop the build folder or connect your repo.
- GitHub Pages: push the static files to the gh-pages branch or use GitHub Actions.

## How it works with v0.app

This repo can stay in sync with deployments made via v0.app:
1. Create and modify your project inside v0.app
2. Deploy from the v0 interface
3. v0.app will push updates to this repository
4. Vercel (or your host) will deploy the latest changes from the repo

## Contributing
